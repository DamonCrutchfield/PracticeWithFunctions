# PracticeWithFunctions

These are exercises to work on in small groups to practice what we have learned so far using JavaScript functions, arrays, iterators, and loops. 

# Instructions

1. Select one group member to be the coder for the group, the coder will follow the following instructions with the help of the group:
    * FORK this repository onto your github
    * Copy the https URL from your forked repo
    * Navigate to Git Bash on your local machine and `cd` to a place you wish to clone this activity to work on it
    * Once where you need to be in bash, run `git clone ` followed by the URL you copied from your forked copy of this github repository
    * Open VSCode, select `File` in the top right, and select `Open Folder` 
    * Find the folder you cloned named `PracticeWithFunctions` and open it, then begin working in the `script.js` file found within the `assetts` folder.

2. Work together to solve each problem / activity within this file as a team. Feel free to utilize Codecademy resources, W3Schools, and anything else you find on Google.

3. When your team is finished with the activity, submit a pull request from your fork!

4. At the end of the allotted time, we will go over these exercises one by one. Group members are expected to raise their hands and guide the class through each solution.
